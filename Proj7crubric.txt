You do a good job defining the two terms, but you should spend a little more time explaining how they are different. How can a person new to computer programming tell when rebinding or mutation is taking place? Is mutating only happening on lists? Can rebinding happen with lists also? This prompt wanted you to do some compare/contrast between the two and explain what makes them different, but you are just defining them both separately.

The explanation of why someone might be confused is really short, and doesn't explain in enough detail
